\section{The Radial Slit Complex [H]}
\label{cellular_models:radial}

We will now construct the radial slit complex $(R,R')$ associated with the moduli space $\ModspcRad$.
Recall that we have defined a homeomorphism $\HarmRad \xr{\cong} \ModspcRad$ (compare Section \ref{cellular:radial_bundle}).
There is a space $\Rad$ of radial slit configurations, which is homeomorphic to $\HarmRad$
and can be defined as the geometric realization of the difference $R - R'$ of the multicomplex $R$ and its subcomplex $R'$.
The latter are described in this section.
Like the parallel slit complex $(P, P')$, $(R, R')$ is only a semi-multisimplicial complex.
In contrast to $\HarmRad$, it has a purely combinatorical description.
Hence, it is very suitable for determining the homology of
\begin{align*}
   H_\ast( \ModspcRad; \Z ) &= H_\ast( \HarmRad; \Z ) \\
                            &\cong H^{3h+n-\ast}( \HarmRad; \mathcal O ) = H^{3h+n-\ast}( \Rad; \mathcal O ) = H^{3h+n-\ast}( R, R'; \mathcal O)
\end{align*}
via a computer program.
Here, the isomorphism is given by Poincar√© duality and $\mathcal O$ is the orientation system, 
for which a simplicial definition is provided in Section \ref{cellular_models:orientation}.

If not stated otherwise, the genus $g$, the number of outgoing boundaries $m$ and the number of incoming boundary curves $n$ are fixed throughout this section.
Be aware that these letters mean different things in the radial case than in the parallel case.
Moreover, the partition $R = (r_1, \dotsc, r_n)$ is always of the form $R = (1, \dotsc, 1)$ here.
Consequently, we have $r = n$ and can omit $r$ as well as the paritition $R$.
\index{partition into levels}
Hence, $[p]$ always denotes the set
\[
    [p] = \{ \ul 0_1, \ul 1_1, \ldots, \ul p_1, \ldots, \ul 0_n, \ul 1_n, \ldots, \ul p_n \}\,,
\]
in the radial case, where $p = p_1+\ldots+p_n$ is a partition of $p$ into $n$ levels with all $p_i$ positive (compare Definition \ref{cellular_models:parallel:partition} for the meaning of $[p]$ in the parallel case). 
As before, we write $h = 2g+m+n-2$ in contrast to the formula for $h$ in the parallel case.

Recall the definition of the fibre over a point $[F, \mathcal C^+, \mathcal C^-, \mathcal P] \in \ModspcRad$ in the homotopy equivalent bundle $\HarmRad$ over $\ModspcRad$ in Section \ref{cellular:radial_bundle}.
We ended up with a function
\[
   W_k = \exp(-u_k) \exp(- i v_k) \colon F_k \to \A_k \subset \C
\]
for each $k = 1, \dotsc, n$.
This maps the basin $F_k$ into an annulus $\A_k$ with inner radius $\rho_k < 1$ and outer radius $1$,
filling the annulus up to some missing slits.
We shall now give a more detailled discription of the image of the maps $W_k$ for $k = 1, \dotsc, n$, 
which we call a \textbf{radial slit picture} (see Figure \ref{trousers_radial}).

\end{figure}

The $n$ annuli $\A_1, \dotsc, \A_n$ are called the annuli or level upon which the radial slit picture resides.
The $k\Th$ incoming boundary curve of the surface $F$ is mapped to the inner boundary cycle of the $k\Th$ annulus,
and the marked point $P_k$ on the incoming boundary curve $C^-_k$ is mapped to the point $(\rho_k, 0)$ on this cycle.
Thus we use to refer to the inner boundary cycle of the $k\Th$ annulus as its $k\Th$ inner boundary.

When we delete an edge of the unstable critical graph from $F$, we obtain, on either side, a bank still belonging to $F$.
Each of these banks may belong to a different basin.
After all maps $W_k$ are applied to the basins $F_k$,
the deleted edges of the critical graph yield missing slits on the annuli.
Thereby, the banks belonging to the same edge may be seperated from each other.
Since there are at most $h$ stagnation points (compare \ref{cellular:radial_bundle}) and each of them results in at most two missing slits,
there are at most $2h$ missing slits on the annuli in total. 
Note that the endpoints of the slits lie anywhere on the annuli apart from their inner and outer boundary cycles. 

An outer boundary curve $C^+_l$ of $F$ is mapped to the outer boundary cycles of the annuli $\A_1, \dotsc, \A_n$,
however not necessarily consecutive or even on one annulus only.
While traversing $C^+_l$ in the surface $F$, one occasionally meets a cut point $Q^+$. 
In particular, this cut point is one endpoint of an edge of the unstable critical graph, so the two banks of this edge may be seperated as described above.
But if we start at an arbitrary point of the image of $C^+_l$ under some map $W_k$,
we can run through the entire image of $C^+_l$ under any map $W_k$ in the annuli $\A_1, \dotsc, \A_n$.
Thereby, we have to jump across paired slits whenever they are met.
We thus refer to these parts of the outer boundary of all annuli $\A_1, \dotsc, \A_n$ as the outer boundary curve of our radial slit picture.
In Figure \ref{trousers_radial}, we can run through the single outer boundary curve along the outer boundary of the annuli clockwise
if we jump from $\alpha$ to $\alpha'$ and from $\beta'$ to $\beta$ on our way.

By adding equipotential lines through the stagnation points, 
we obtain $0 \leq q \leq h$ concentrical lines on each annulus $\A_k$.
Extending the lines of the slits towards the inner and outer boundary of $\A_k$,
we obtain a subdivision of each annulus into regions.

This completes our description of a radial slit picture.
Vice versa, the surface $F$ can be obtained from the radial slit picture.  
We can re-glue previously connected basins along the missing slits in order to re-construct the surface $F$.
Note that the resulting surface is the same if slits move in the annuli, or even if smaller slits jump across larger slits.
Thus, such radial slit pictures are considered as equal.

In order to obtain a multisimplicial description of these radial slit pictures, 
we will normalize them in the following subsection, resulting in a new structure called cell.
Note that two regions are only glued together if they lie in the same concentrical stripe of any annulus (maybe on two different annuli).
Hence, we can express the glueing via one permutation $\sigma_j \in \SymGr_{[p]}$ per concentrical stripe $0 \leq j \leq q$,
where $[p]$ is the set
\[
[p] = \{ \ul 0_1, \ul 1_1, \ldots, \ul p_1, \ldots, \ul 0_n, \ul 1_n, \ldots, \ul p_n \}\,,
\]
which denotes the radial segments of the $k\Th$ annulus by $\ul 0_k, \dotsc, \ul p_k$.
In the Subsections \ref{cellular_models:radial:cells_in_homogenous_notation} and \ref{cellular_models:radial:cells_in_inhomogenous_notation},
we will see how exactly this defines the cells $\Sigma = homogq$ of the relative multicomplex $(R, R')$, using two different perspectives.

The positions of the slits define an inner point of the multisimplex $\Delta^p \times \Delta^q$.
Collapsing concentrical stripes and radial segments defines vertical and horizontal faces of the cells,
see Subsection \ref{cellular_models:radial:faces}.
After this preparation, we can introduce the radial slit complex $(R, R')$ in Subsection \ref{cellular_models:radial:bisimplicial_complex}.
