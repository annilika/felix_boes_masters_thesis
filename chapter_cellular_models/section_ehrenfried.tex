\section{The Ehrenfried Complex}
\label{cellular_models:ehrenfried}
In this section, we treat the radial slit complex and parallel slit complex at once.
In order to reduce notation, we only mention the parallel model most of the time.

The homology of the moduli spaces as well as homology operations are derived via the relative cohomology of the dual of $P/P'$.
Due to Ehrenfried, there is a considerably smaller, quasi-isomorphic subcomplex $\E$ of the total complex $Tot(P/P')$ for $n=1$.
The subcomplex $\E$ has a distinguished basis and is called the {\bf Ehrenfried complex associated with $\Modspc[1]$}.
Using Visy's techniques, we construct the Ehrenfried complex for arbitrary $P(h,g;r_1, \ldots, r_n)$ and $R(g,n,m)$ as follows.
