\section{Two Families of Moduli Spaces}
\todo{Sektion noch machen?}
% Consider the moduli spaces $\MM$ as classifying space $B\Gamma$ of the corresponding mapping class group, i.e.\ 
% (1) let $\Modspc = B\Gamma_{g,n}^m$ where $\Gamma_{g,n}^m$ is the group of orientation preserving isotopy classes of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms that
% fix the $n$ boundary curves and $m$ punctures pointwise;
% and (2) let $\ModspcRad = B\Gamma_g^\bullet(m,n)$ where $\Gamma_g^\bullet(m,n)$ is the group of orientation preserving isotopy classes of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms that
% fix the $n$ boundary curves pointwise and map every remaining component into itself.
% 
% It is readily seen that these two mapping class groups are isomorphic:
% Consider a diffeomorphism $f$ that represents an element in $\Gamma_g^\bullet(m,n)$ and extend it to the surface obtained from glueing half-open cylinders onto every outgoing boundary curve.
% In the resulting surface, we interpret the open side of the cylinders as puncture (compare Figure \ref{introduction:moduli_spaces:extending_diffeo}).
% Thus, the obtained diffeomorphism $\Phi(f)$ is an element in $\Gamma_{g,n}^m$.

% 
% Conversely, consider a diffeomorphism $f$ representing an element in $\Gamma_{g,n}^m$.
% Using standard techniques, it is easy to alter $f$ in a neighbourhood of a puncture $p$ (by an isotopic map also-called $f$) such that
% its restriction to an possibly smaller neighbourhood $U_p \cong S^1 \times [0,1)$ is constant in the second coordinate.
% Thus we can extend $f$ to a surface with $m$ outgoing boundary curves and obtain an element in $\Psi(f) \in \Gamma_g^\bullet(m,n)$.
% 
% The maps $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are clearly homomorphisms and inverse to each other.
% We prooved the following proposition.
% 
% \begin{prop}
%     The mapping class groups $\Gamma_{g,n}^m$ and $\Gamma_g^\bullet(m,n)$ are isomorphic.
%     Therefore
%     \[
%         \Modspc \simeq \ModspcRad \,.
%     \]
% \end{prop}
