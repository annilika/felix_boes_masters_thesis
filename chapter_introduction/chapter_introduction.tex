\chapter{Introduction}
In this thesis, we study two families of moduli spaces:

\noindent
(1) the moduli spaces $\Modspc[n]$ of Riemann surfaces of genus $g \ge 0$ with $m \ge 0$ (permutable) punctures and $n \ge 1$ boundary curves and

\noindent
(2) the moduli spaces $\ModspcRad$ of Riemann surfaces of genus $g \ge 0$ with $n \ge 1$ incoming and $m \ge 1$ outgoing boundary curves (the moduli space of cobordisms) and
with an extra marked point on each of the boundary incoming curves.

The latter are important for string topology or conformal field theories; the former (but for $n=m=0$) are the classical moduli space from algebraic geometry or complex analysis.
For our techniques to work, we always need $n \ge 1$ in case (1) and $n,m \ge 1$ in case (2).

Under these assumptions of non-empty boundary, the moduli spaces $\Modspc$ and $\ModspcRad$ are manifolds of dimension $6g-6+2m+4n$ respectively $6g-6+3m+3n$.
They are orientable for $m < 2$.
Moreover, they are homotopy equivalent to the classifying spaces $B\Gamma_{g,n}^m$ respectively $B\Gamma^\bullet_g(m,n)$ of the mapping class groups $\Gamma_{g,n}^m$ respectively $\Gamma^\bullet_g(m,n)$.

In this introduction, we review the stable and unstable (co-)homology of the moduli spaces and present our results.
At the end, we explain the organization of our thesis.
