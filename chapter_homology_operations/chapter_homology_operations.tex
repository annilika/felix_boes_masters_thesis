\chapter{Homology Operations}
\label{homology_operations}

[B] In this chapter, we discuss well-known homology operations defined on the space of parallel slit domains or the space of radial slit domains.
We relate them via the parallelization and radialization map
and realize them by cochainmaps using our formula for the coboundary operator.
