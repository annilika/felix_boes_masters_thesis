\section{The Program Kappa}
\label{chapter_program:kappa}

The program {\bf kappa} mainly uses the previously introduced {\bf libhomology} (compare Section \ref{program:libhomology}) 
and the theory developed in Chapter \ref{cellular_models}
in order to determine the homology of the moduli spaces $\Modspc[1]$ and $\ModspcRad[1]$. 
Thus, it computes the cohomology of the parallel or radial Ehrenfried complex $\Ehrprog$,
filtered by cluster sizes.

Recall that the homology of $\Modspc[1]$ and $\ModspcRad[1]$ coincides for $m > 0$, see Proposition \ref{cellular_models:comparision_of_the_models:bundles_are_h_equiv}.
For computing the homology of $\Modspc[1]$ for fixed $g$ and $m$, 
it is more efficient to use the radial Ehrenfried complex rather than the parallel one, 
since its modules and thus differentials are much smaller, see Section \ref{complexity:number_of_mono_cells}.
However, for $m = 0$, we cannot use the radial model, so we also offer the computation of the homology of $\Modspc[1]$ via the parallel model.
Since we also determine the dimensions of the modules of the cluster spectral sequence, 
computation with the parallel model produces new homological information for $m > 0$.

A central class of our computer program is hence the class \progclass{ClusterSpectralSequence}, see Subsection \ref{chapter_program:kappa:css},
which stores the parallel or radial Ehrenfried complex filtered by cluster sizes.

Since the basis elements of $\Ehrprog$ are monotonous tuples of transpositions,
another important class of the program kappa is the class \progclass{Tuple} (see Subsection \ref{chapter_program:kappa:tuple}),
which represents such a basis element and offers many functions that are applied to it
during the generation of the \progclass{ClusterSpectralSequence}.

With these foundations, we can offer the tool \progname{compute\_css} (see Subsection \ref{chapter_program:kappa:compute_css}) 
for computing the first three pages of the cluster spectral sequences corresponding to the moduli spaces $\Modspc[1]$ and $\ModspcRad[1]$
and especially their homology.

We also provide the tool \progname{compute\_cache},
which computes the bases and the differentials of $\Ehrprog$ and stores them in files via serialization.
For most $g$ and $m$, 
the computation of both takes a lot of time,
and it is thus functional to have the opportunity to store the data of $\Ehrprog$ for later uses.

For example, \progname{compute\_cache} can be used to examine the structure of the Ehrenfried complex via the tools
\progname{compute\_statistics} and \progname{print\_basis}.
After \progname{compute\_cache} has been performed, one can call \progname{compute\_statistics}
to find out various properties of the Ehrenfried complex $\Ehrprog$
like the sizes of the differentials or their largest entry per column.
Alternatively, a call of \progname{print\_basis} outputs the basis of the Ehrenfried complex.

Since all these tools mentioned are organized in a similar way, 
we shall only describe the tool \progname{compute\_css} in detail, see Subsection \ref{chapter_program:kappa:compute_css}.
Thereafter, we illustrate the above mentioned classes \progclass{Tuple} (compare Subsection \ref{chapter_program:kappa:tuple}) and \progclass{ClusterSpectralSequence} (compare Subsection \ref{chapter_program:kappa:css}),
which describe the Ehrenfried complex.
