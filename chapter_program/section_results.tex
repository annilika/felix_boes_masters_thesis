\section{Results}
\label{program:results}

As discussed above, our program computes the cluster spectral sequence of a given Ehrenfried complex, i.e.\ we compute the cohomology of the associated moduli space.
In this section, we list the results our computer program provides.
Hereby, we distinct the parallel and radial case.
We compute the cluster spectral sequence with respect to coefficients $R$ being either the rationals $\mathbb Q$ or the field $\mathbb F_2$.
Given parameters $g$ and $m$, we provide several tables with entries $\dim_R E^s_{p,l}$ for
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $s$ equals $0$, $1$ or $2$,
    \item $p$ the homological degree and
    \item $l$ the cluster number.
\end{enumerate}
The rightmost column of each table notes $\dim_R \sum_{l} E^s_{p,l}$.
For $s=2$, we thus provide the dimensions of the homology of the moduli spaces $\dim_R H_{2h-p}(\mathfrak M;R)$,
where $h = 2g+m$ in the parallel case and $h = 2g + m -1$ in the radial case.
